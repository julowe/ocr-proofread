# Example docker-compose file using pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry
# This is the simplest way to deploy without building the image locally
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prebuilt.yml up -d
#
# Note: The config.yaml volume mount is commented out by default.
# The application will use its built-in default configuration.
# Uncomment and update the path if you want to use a custom config file.
